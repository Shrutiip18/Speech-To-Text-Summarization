# Speech-To-Text-Summarization
This project presents a comprehensive web application for automatic speech-to-text conversion, summarization, translation, and visualization using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition techniques.

## Objective:
This project was created by me and my team members as a part of minor project-1 which involved building an intelligent, user-friendly web application that automates transcription, summarization, translation, and visualization of audio, video, and text content.
Manual transcription is often tedious and error-prone. To address this, the system integrates AI and NLP tools into a single workflow. It supports real-time speech input, file uploads (audio, video, text, PDF, DOCX), and YouTube links.
The app uses AssemblyAI for speech-to-text, Hugging Face transformers for summarization, and Google Translate for multilingual support. Visualizations are generated using Plotly, word clouds, and Graphviz flowcharts. Built with Streamlit, the interface is simple and interactive. It also supports speaker diarization for identifying different speakers in audio, making it ideal for meetings and interviews.


## Features:
1. converts audio, video files and real-time audio.
2. summarizes long transcriptions into key points.
3. translates the summary into different languages (English, Hindi German, French Spanish).
4. visualizes the summarized content.
